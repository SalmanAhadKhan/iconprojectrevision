    <p>New York’s streets and residents were not prepared for the devastation caused by Hurricane Ida last week. It came just one week after Hurricane Henri, which, at the time, set a record for the most rainfall ever recorded in New York when Central Park collected 1.94 inches of rain in one hour.

    <p>When Ida hit, it broke all the records.

    </p>
    <p>In a normal year, Central Park collects around 4.3 inches of rain over the whole month of September. With Ida, the park got more than 7 inches of rain in just a few hours.

    <p>In a press conference on Thursday, Governor Kathy Hochul, Senator Chuck Schumer, and Mayor Bill DeBlasio said that this is the new normal we should all get ready for.

    “There are no more unforeseen, cataclysmic events. We need to foresee these in advance, and be prepared.”

    Schumer says this is the time to take the kind of legislative action that could have an immediate and long-lasting impact.

    </p>
    <p>
      “When you get two record rainfalls in a week, it's not just coincidence. When you get all the changes that we have seen in weather. That's not a coincidence … it's going to get worse and worse and worse unless we do something about it. And that's why it's so imperative to pass the two bills. The infrastructure bill, and the budget reconciliation bill.” He says the infrastructure bill can help us develop facilities that are more resilient. Those that can consistently withstand the kind of rainfall we saw last week.

        <p>Schumer is referring to a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill. It is likely to face a lot of difficulty because of the financial and political capital needed to pass such legislation. <br>

        <p>While the bill has faced severe pushback from Republicans, it has also faced pushback internally within the Democratic party. The centrists say it’s too expensive. The progressives refuse to make any further compromises on the budget.<br>

  <p>
    Schumer just says something needs to be done asap.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Woe is us. If we don't recognize these changes are due to climate change, woe is us. If we don't do something about it quickly.”
